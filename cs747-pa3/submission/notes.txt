The evaluation is based on Mean Square error.
As we know that Monte carlo gives the Best fit which reduces the mean Square error between esitmated and actual.
I implemented the Batch update - Monte carlo every visit algorithm.
My algorithm gives error less than 0.001 for both of the given episodes.
